### Feature 3

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

I took inspiration from pintrest as well as other dashboard designs i had seen when practicing React. Management portals needed to be
clean and well thought out, by getting the nav off the page it kept the page a lot cleaner.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

-

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- The highlight for me was getting familiar with JSX and the other react syntax, it proved to be challenging but extremely
  worthwhile when everything came together.
- I really enjoyed working with Chart js even though it proved to be an issue throughout, i really enjoyed the data visualization aspect.

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- In the future i would like to get my timeline page fully functioning as i was not quite able to complete it due to time restrictions
- I would like to actually implement a way for users to access the blockchain (I'm aiming high) through my website and possibly even
  make transactions, who knows :).

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
