## Concept Process and road map

I took inspiration from pintrest as well as other dashboard designs i had seen when practicing React. Management portals needed to be
clean and well thought out, by getting the nav off the page it kept the page a lot cleaner.
<br/>
I wanted the website to be as 'real life' as possible, so my main aim was to maintain a high level regarding the UI and UX
